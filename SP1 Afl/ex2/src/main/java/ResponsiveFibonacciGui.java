/**
 * <h2>Task 4</h2>
 * <p>
 * This task is about making a Fibonacci GUI responsive. This GUI is admittedly not very pretty, but does its job.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * First create and show the GUI. You can get some inspiration in the {@link FibonacciGui} class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Notice that this class implements a {@link GuiObserver} which can listen for any events coming from the GUI.
 * Exploit this to start the calculation when the {@link #startCalculation(long)} method is called.
 * </p>
