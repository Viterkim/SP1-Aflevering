/**
 * <h2>Task 2</h2>
 * <p>
 * By using the {@link UrlRetriever} you implemented in the previous exercise, your job is now to run synchronously
 * and asynchronously.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * First of all find three different {@link java.net.URL}s you can use. Then create three instances of the
 * {@link UrlRetriever} with these URL's.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The first subtask is to execute the three {@link UrlRetriever}s with the {@link UrlRetriever#run()}
 * method. Note that this is <b>not</b> the start method, so the code is run synchronously.</li>
 * <li>The second subtask is to change the execution to use {@link UrlRetriever#start()}. Remember that this
 * starts an asynchronous thread, so you need to wait for them all to finish!</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Both methods will print a run-time on the execution. Can you see a difference on how fast it went? Can you
 * explain why you get that result?
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Try to run the {@link #getAvailableProcessors()} method to see how many processors you have. Perhaps this
 * can explain the result.
 * </p>
